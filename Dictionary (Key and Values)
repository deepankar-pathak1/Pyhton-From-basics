# how we can findout the value of keys and values in a list.
# Here we have created a dictionary with the name of names and we are going to apply for loop and finding the keys and values.

# Code is

names = {"Deepanakr":"Values","Age":"42"}
# for values in names.values():
#     print(values)
for keys in names.keys():
    print(keys)
# we can also find out the items of Dictionary as follows


for items in names.items():
    print(items)
# Notice this the value return by .items() is tuples of keya and values pairs.


print(names.keys())

print(list(names.keys()))

# Output is 

dict_keys(['Deepanakr', 'Age'])

['Deepanakr', 'Age']

# we can iter keys and values pairs at a same time with the help of for loop as follows

for keys,values in names.items():
    print(f"Key is : {keys} and Value is : {values}")
    
    
# as we have learned earlier to check the value in a list we uses a in and not in opreratot similarily we can use for dictionary as:-

print("Deepankr" in names.values())
print("Deepanakr" in names.keys()).

# Output are

False
True

print("Values" not in names.values())

False
