# how we can findout the value of keys and values in a list.
# Here we have created a dictionary with the name of names and we are going to apply for loop and finding the keys and values.

# Code is

names = {"Deepanakr":"Values","Age":"42"}
# for values in names.values():
#     print(values)
for keys in names.keys():
    print(keys)
# we can also find out the items of Dictionary as follows


for items in names.items():
    print(items)
# Notice this the value return by .items() is tuples of keya and values pairs.
