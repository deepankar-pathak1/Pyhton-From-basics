# A raw string completely ignores all escape characters and
prints any backslash that appears in the string.

name = 'Hey\'s what\'s up\t what are you doing\n'
print(name)
print(r'Hey\'s what\'s up\t what are you doing\n')

Hey's what's up	 what are you doing

Hey\'s what\'s up\t what are you doing\n

# Because pyhton consider backslash part as a string not a escape character
