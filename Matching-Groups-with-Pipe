# Matching Multiple groups with pipe
# The | character is called a pipe.
# You can use it anywhere you want to match one of many expressions.
# For example, the regular expression r'Batman|Tina Fey' will match either 'Batman' or 'Tina Fey'.
# When both Batman and Tina Fey occur in the searched string, the first
# occurrence of matching text will be returned as the Match object.

work_pipe = re.compile(r'Pathak|Deepankar|Pathak')

mo_1 = work_pipe.search("Deepankar and Pathak")
print(mo_1.group())

Deepankar




# You can also use the pipe to match one of several patterns as part of your regex.
# For example, say you wanted to match any of the strings 'Batman','Batmobile', 'Batcopter', and 'Batbat'.
# Since all these strings start with Bat, it would be nice if you could specify that prefix only once.
# This can be done with parentheses.

batReg = re.compile(r'Bat(man|mobile|copter|bat)')
mo_me = batReg.search('Batman') #Dont use batReg.search("Batman") it will lead to error
print(mo_me.group())



Batman



# If you need to match an actual pipe character, escape it with a backslash, like \|
